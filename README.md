# tea-flower-model
There are data and code that were used in a tea flower quantifying study, titled "Dynamic Estimation of Tea Flowering Based on an Improved YOLOv5 and ANN Model".
This project comprises four branches: the dataset, TflosYOLO, TFSC, and tea flowering dynamics visualization.

Details:

The tea-flower dataset includes a selection of images of tea flowers. 

TflosYOLO was obtained by training and improving the YOLOv5 model, the purpose is to achieve tea flower detection and output the flower count as a CSV file for detailed data analysis.

The TFSC (Tea Flowering Stage Classification) model is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This project provides the model architecture and the corresponding code for its implementation.

The tea flowering dynamics visualization code generates dynamic change graphs for three types of flower counts: flower buds, blooming flowers (B flowers), and withered flowers (W flowers) over time.
